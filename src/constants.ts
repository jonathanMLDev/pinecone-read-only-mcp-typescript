const SERVER_FEATURES_AND_NOTES = `A semantic search server that provides hybrid search capabilities over Pinecone vector indexes with automatic namespace discovery.

Features:
- Hybrid Search: Combines dense and sparse embeddings for superior recall
- Semantic Reranking: Uses a configurable reranker model when PINECONE_RERANK_MODEL is set; disabled when unset
- Dynamic Namespace Discovery: Automatically discovers available namespaces
- Metadata Filtering: Supports optional metadata filters for refined searches
- Namespace Router: Suggests likely namespace(s) from natural-language intent
- Count: Use the count tool for "how many X?" questions; it uses semantic search only and minimal fields (no content) for performance, returning unique document count.
- URL Generation: Use generate_urls to synthesize URLs for namespaces that have a registered generator when metadata lacks url.
- Document reassembly: Use query_documents to get whole documents (chunks grouped and merged by document_number/doc_id/url) for content analysis or summarization. query_documents reranks when a rerank model is configured.
- Keyword search: Use keyword_search to query the sparse index for lexical/keyword-only retrieval without reranking.

Notes:
- Result rows include both \`document_id\` (canonical) and \`paper_number\` (deprecated alias kept for one minor cycle; will be removed in the next major release). Prefer \`document_id\` in new code.
- The server emits structured logs to stderr (text by default, set PINECONE_READ_ONLY_MCP_LOG_FORMAT=json for log aggregation).`;

/** MCP instructions for {@link setupCoreServer} (seven core tools only). */
export const CORE_SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `Quickstart for AI clients: call \`list_namespaces\` to discover namespaces, optionally \`namespace_router\` to rank candidates from user intent, then \`query\` (preset fast/detailed/full), \`count\`, \`query_documents\`, \`keyword_search\`, or \`generate_urls\` as needed. For \`setupCoreServer\` / package-root \`resolveConfig\`, \`PINECONE_INDEX_NAME\` (or \`--index-name\`) is required in addition to \`PINECONE_API_KEY\`. Misconfiguration surfaces at startup, not as tool errors.

${SERVER_FEATURES_AND_NOTES}

Usage:
1. Use list_namespaces (cached) to discover available namespaces in the index. The response includes \`expires_at_iso\` so you know when to refresh.
2. Optionally use namespace_router to choose candidate namespace(s) from user intent.
3. Use count for count questions, \`query\` with the appropriate preset for chunk-level retrieval, query_documents for full-document content, keyword_search for lexical retrieval, or generate_urls when records need synthesized URLs.`;

/** Alliance-only supplement appended to core instructions for {@link setupAllianceServer}. */
export const ALLIANCE_INSTRUCTIONS_APPENDIX = `

Alliance quickstart: for most user questions, call \`guided_query\` with the user's question — it does namespace routing, suggestion, and execution in one shot and returns a decision_trace you can show the user. The Alliance CLI and \`resolveAllianceConfig\` default the index to \`rag-hybrid\` (and rerank to \`bge-reranker-v2-m3\`) when those env vars are omitted.

For manual flows with the full tool surface, call \`list_namespaces\` -> \`suggest_query_params\` -> \`query\` (use preset fast/detailed/full per suggestion) or \`count\` (the suggest step is a mandatory gate unless \`PINECONE_DISABLE_SUGGEST_FLOW=true\`).

Alliance usage (after list_namespaces):
4. Call suggest_query_params before query/count/query_documents tools (mandatory flow gate) to get suggested_fields and recommended_tool.
5. Use count for count questions, \`query\` with the appropriate preset for chunk-level retrieval, or query_documents for full-document content.`;
